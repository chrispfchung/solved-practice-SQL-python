Problem:
Return Odd or Even depending on given number

My Solution:
```python
def even_or_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"
```

Top Solution on Codewars:
```python
def even_or_odd(number):
  return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'
```

My Thoughts:
It's interesting to see my results compared to the top clever post.
Usually the main difference between mine and theirs is that theirs is more succinct.
I love to see the one-liners on their posts. It's similar to writing where you say
the same thing but in general a better way.
